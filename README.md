Definition:
      This is a calculator software based on a programming language –Python. 
      It allows user to input their mathematical number and operators as they 
       wish in a friendly manner and gives result.   The main function of this 
       software uses parsing/shunting yard algorithm. In a shunting yard algorithm, 
        expression is parsed left to right. Each time a number or operand is read, it 
        pushes it to the stack. Each time an operator comes up, it pops the required 
        operands from the stack, perform the operations, and push the result back to the stack.

Things you should know before you use it!!
      This software’s’ interface is texted based. This software requires you to be cautious in 
      inserting your inputs. You need to add a space after each math input in order to get the 
       result because this is how it’s coded. If you forget or try to force, your calculation without 
        space it will simply give you an error result. 

A quick example of how you are required to type your input in this software is given below.

a) -5.78 + -1 * ( 4 - 2.23 ) + sin ( 0 ) * cos ( 1 ) / ( 1 + tan ( 2 * ln ( -3 + 2 * ( 1.23 + 99.111 ) ) )
b) ( ( 2 + 3 / ) ( 4 / -

Version Control:
      I have uploaded the software in github as a version control.  
      Version control systems assign an identifier to every version of 
      every file, and track their relationships. They also allow branches 
      in those versions, and merging those branches back into the main line 
      of work. They also support having multiple copies on multiple computers 
       for backup, and for collaboration. And finally, they let you tag particular versions,
       such that it is easy to return to a set of files exactly as they were when you tagged 
       them. For example, the exact versions of data, code, and narrative that were used when 
         a manuscript was originally submitted might be eco-ms-1 in the graph above, and then
         when it was revised and resubmitted, it was done with tag eco-ms-2.
